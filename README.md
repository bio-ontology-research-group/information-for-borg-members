# Getting started

Welcome to the BORG. You have just arrived and are probably a bit lost on how best to get started with your research. Here are some useful tips to get started in the BORG:

* Our group admin is Hanouf Al Hattan (Hanouf.AlHattan@kaust.edu.sa). She sits in Building 3, Level 4, sea-side, in the CBRC area. Hanouf will be able to organize your KAUST ID, KAUST login, research equipment, stationary, etc. Hanouf will also plan and register your travels.
* Once you have a KAUST login and email, register and sign in to http://scale-kaust.slack.com/ and join the #borg channel. Ask  user @leechuck to add you to this private channel.
* The BORG group calendar is available at https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=cWoybXQwNXJuNGc2MDJ2bjJoZmlxMGM2dWdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ you can find our events (group meeting, journal club) there.
* Get the Github Education Pack for free at https://education.github.com/
* For any IT-related help, send an email to ithelpdesk@kaust.edu.sa or go to the IT walk-in helpdesk in Building 14.

* Register at https://trello.com/ and join https://trello.com/b/4IbXybSm/papers-and-projects to see active projects in our group.

# Research tips
* You work will almost certainly involve use of our HPC environment. Get yourself familiar with our cluster by logging in at alogin.dragon.kaust.edu.sa.
* You will almost certainly have to work on the command line. If you have not used the command line before, print https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf and pin it to your workspace!
* You should use an editor suitable for coding both on a graphical interface and the command line. `vim` and `emacs` are good places to start. If you have not used them, print https://github.com/hackjutsu/vim-cheatsheet (for vim) or https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf (for emacs) and pin it on the other side of your workspace.
